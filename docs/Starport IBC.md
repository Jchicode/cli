# Starport IBC

## Scaffolding chain `foo`

To start using IBC with Starport open up a [web-based development environment](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/tendermint/starport/), then scaffold and launch a Stargate chain:

```
starport app github.com/foo/foo --sdk-version stargate

cd foo

starport serve
```

You now have a blockchain `foo` running, but it's not connected to anything yet.

## Scaffolding chain `bar`

To connect this blockchain to another one, open up one more [web-based development environment](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/tendermint/starport/) instance and follow the steps above to scaffold and launch another chain (let's call it `bar`).

Once the chain is running, you will see a "Relayer info" string in the terminal output (your string will be different):

```
âœ¨ Relayer info: eyJDaGFpbklEIjoiYmFyIiwiTW5lbW9uaWMiOiJmcm9zdCByYXpvciBoYWxmIGxhdW5kcnkgcHJvZml0IHdpc2UgdG9uZSBibHVzaCBzdXJnZSBrZWVwIHRvZ2V0aGVyIHNsaWNlIHlvdXRoIHRydXRoIGVubGlzdCBjdXBib2FyZCBhYnNvcmIgc2VlZCBzZXJpZXMgZG91YmxlIHZpbGxhZ2UgdG9uZ3VlIGZsYXNoIGdvcmlsbGEiLCJSUENBZGRyZXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly8yNjY1Ny1jNzllNDk2ZC1kZDk4LTQ4MWQtOTlmZi1jZGQ4OTA2NWQ4MWIud3MtZXUwMS5naXRwb2QuaW86NDQzIn0
```

This is a `base64` encoded JSON that contains information about the chain ID, a relayer account mnemonic and an RPC URL.

## Connecting `foo` with `bar`

To connect these chains together, copy the relayer info of chain `bar`, switch to the terminal of chain `foo` and run the following command (use your own string):

```
starport chain add eyJDaGFpbklEIjoiYmFyIiwiTW5lbW9uaWMiOiJmcm9zdCByYXpvciBoYWxmIGxhdW5kcnkgcHJvZml0IHdpc2UgdG9uZSBibHVzaCBzdXJnZSBrZWVwIHRvZ2V0aGVyIHNsaWNlIHlvdXRoIHRydXRoIGVubGlzdCBjdXBib2FyZCBhYnNvcmIgc2VlZCBzZXJpZXMgZG91YmxlIHZpbGxhZ2UgdG9uZ3VlIGZsYXNoIGdvcmlsbGEiLCJSUENBZGRyZXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly8yNjY1Ny1jNzllNDk2ZC1kZDk4LTQ4MWQtOTlmZi1jZGQ4OTA2NWQ4MWIud3MtZXUwMS5naXRwb2QuaW86NDQzIn0
```

Chain `foo` will now restart and you should see information about two being connected:

```
Detected chains, linking them...
Linked foo <--> bar
```

## Sending tokens from `foo` to `bar`

Once the chains are connected, you can use a relayer CLI `rly` to create an IBC token send transaction:

```
rly tx transfer foo bar 5token $(rly chains address bar)
```

After a transaction is successfully created, you can now relay it to a connected chain: 

```
rly tx relay foo-bar
```

## Checking token balances on chain `bar`

To verify that an IBC transaction was relayed correctly, let's check the balances of our relayer account:

```
bard q bank balances $(bard keys show bar -a --keyring-backend test)
```

This command will output token balances for the relayer account and you should see 5 token transfered with IBC.

## Configuration

Inside your chain's project directory you will see `secret.yml`. This file contains information about the local chain's relayer account (under `accounts` property) and relayer accounts of connected chains (under `relayer` property).

Once the chain is launched with `starport serve`, Starport uses information from `secret.yml` to create a relayer config in `~/.relayer/`. Every time the chain is restarted relayer config is reset, and connections are re-established.
